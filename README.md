# Ansible

## Purpose
Designed to be able to rebuild/update my laptop with minimal manual effort. Inspired by @ThePrimeagen.

## Getting Started
Bootstrap with the following command and then use ansible to run the playbooks you need:

```
sh -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rogeraird/ansible/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```
